A simple **3-tier architecture** demo built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
The app allows users to **post lost or found items** and **claim items**, with a rule to prevent claiming your own post.

- Collections:

  - `items`: `{ _id, type, title, desc, posted_by, claimed_by }`

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Tier (Node.js + Express)**
- Handles API requests and business logic
- Enforces rules (e.g., cannot claim your own post)
- Communicates with MongoDB using Mongoose
- Authentication with JWT

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Tier (React)**
- Displays items in cards
- Login form for authentication
- Claim button for unclaimed items
- Uses `fetch()` to call backend APIs
